## About

👋 Welcome! **This is the personal repository of a Full-Stack developer (.NET + Angular)**, where I collect everything I’ve learned or discovered in real projects.

🔬 I don’t just read theory – I want to see **how it works in practice**! Here you’ll find hands-on examples of basic tools and practical solutions to complex problems you can try yourself.

💡 Even simple concepts are easy to forget, and revisiting them often means writing small console projects. To save time and stay organized, I keep everything in one structured place.

🤝 I’m open to collaboration!

📦 This repository is my personal experience vault, which will continue to grow. New examples, ideas, and practices appear as I learn and work on real projects.

**Small for now 🌱 but growing with each step toward something greater 🌳!**

## .NET
